README latex2image 0.1.2.dev

latex2image renders latex formulae into PNG, and can either be used as a simple
command-line tool or as a web service for rendering latex code on-the-fly. The
web service employs a caching mechanism, thus avoiding to generate graphics for
the same latex formulae more than once.


INSTALLATION

1. Extract latex2image

Extract the latex2image-XYZ.tar.gz archive to the desired location on your web
server. For the rest of the installation instructions, let us assume that you
installed latex2image like this:

/home/jdoe/latex2image
  |- tmp/
  |- cache/
  |- latex2image
  |- latex2image.php
  |- template.tex
  |- deny.png

You might need to adjust permissions for the directories tmp and cache.

2. Make latex2image accessible

Assuming that /home/jdoe/example.com is your web root for www.example.com, you
now create a symbolic link to latex2image.php from /home/jdoe/example.com

ln -s /home/jdoe/latex2image/latex2image.php /home/jdoe/example.com/latex2image.php

3. Test latex2image

Send a request to your web server like this:

http://www.example.com/latex2image.php?latex=$$\square$$

The script will prove to be operational if it returns a PNG picture showing a
small square.


NOTES ON SECURITY

I do not guarantee for the security of the script, as it might be dangerous
to compile user-provided Latex input on the server. I have written the
tool with the best of my knowledge (any comments welcome):

* explicitly disabled write18 latex commands by feeding latex with the
  -no-shell-escape command line option.
* using dvips with the -R2 option
* citing from http://www.pd.infn.it/TeX/doc/html/web2c/web2c_4.html
        "TeX can write output files, via the \openout primitive; this opens a
        security hole vulnerable to Trojan horse attack: an unwitting user
        could run a TeX program that overwrites, say, `~/.rhosts'. (MetaPost
        has a write primitive with similar implications). To alleviate this,
        there is a configuration variable openout_any, which selects one of
        three levels of security. When it is set to `a' (for "any"), no
        restrictions are imposed. When it is set to `r' (for "restricted"),
        filenames beginning with `.' are disallowed (except `.tex' because
        LaTeX needs it). When it is set to `p' (for "paranoid") additional
        restrictions are imposed: an absolute filename must refer to a file in
        (a subdirectory) of TEXMFOUTPUT, and any attempt to go up a directory
        level is forbidden (that is, paths may not contain a `..' component).
        The paranoid setting is the default. (For backwards compatibility, `y'
        and `1' are synonyms of `a', while `n' and `0' are synonyms for `r'.)"
  latex2image relies on this.
